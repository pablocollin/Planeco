# Planeco
code.jam() 2022 project -Team Payet

Planeco is a website based on python's flask framework, that aims to simplify and reinvent corporate scheduling 
with respect to rising challenges: sustainability and space limitations (sanitary restrictions, cost, ...).

Our algorithm processes databases of employees inputted by the company, and generates a schedule optimizing the
environmental impact of transportition, the mental health balance of the employees, as well as their safety
regarding the pandemic. 

Instructions:
- Run the view.py file, this will initiate the flask application
- Open the local url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (default port used by Flask is 5000 but it might differ from user to user)

Note:
- You might need to install the flask module if you haven't already. To do so, you can import it via the terminal using the command ``pip3 intall flask``
- If you are getting a 403 error when trying to access the local url, try emptying your browser cache.

We hope you will like the project!
